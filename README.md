# Project Description:

[APItizers](https://api-tizers.netlify.app/) is a meal recommendation app for those days when you don't know what to eat. 

Users can search by ingredient, or click on one of the many ingredients displayed on the home page, and they will get a list of meal recommendations. From there, they can click on a meal to get the recipe and preparation instructions.
